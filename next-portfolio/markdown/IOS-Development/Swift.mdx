# Swift

## iOS Development

Four main issues:

- **Swift**: A unique and powerful language, but it has its own learning curve.
- **Xcode**: Apple's IDE is powerful and flexible, and therefore it is also complex and hard to learn.
- **iOS** Library: As with all OO frameworks, learning to use the libraries is essential and complicated.
- **Design**: With iOS you are not simply designing something that looks good, but you are designing something that must meet with Apple's standards.

We'll tackle all four over the length of the course, but the focus right now is on Swift as a general-purpose programming language.

## Swift

This presumes that you have prior experience in Java, C# or C++. In addition, it should be noted that as a new language Swift has seen extensive changes in the last few years. The information provided here is intended for Swift 3+, and may not work in Swift 1 or 2.

## Variables

Swift uses strict and strong typing, and is type safe. Some of the most common data types are:

- **Bool**: a standard boolean. Values can be true or false.
- **Character**: a single Unicode character.
- **Int**: Signed integer, size by default varies per platform: Int32 on 32 bit, Int64 on 64 bit. Int8 is the equivalent to a Byte in Java.
- **Uint**: Unsigned (non-negative) integer, and like Int the size varies by platform. Uint8 is the equivalent to a Byte in C#.
- **Double** and **Float**: Standard floating point variables, 64 bit for Double, 32 bit for Float. Double is generally preferred.
- **String**: String works as expected. Note that String is a value type â€“ it passes a value when copied, not a pointer.

### Declaration

Variables use the "var" keyword and the format:

Format:
var [name]: [type] = [value]

For example:

```swift
var number: Int = 5
```

If the value is provided, the type can be declared implicitly based on the value type. For example:

```swift
var number = 5
var name = "Stewart"
```

However, the type is essential if no value is provided, or if there is a risk of multiple data types holding the same value.

```swift
var number: Int
var name: String
```

To make a variable **read-only**, use "let"

```swift
let number = 5
```

### Access

Variables can be:

- public
- private
- internal (default)

```swift
public var x: Int = 60
private var y: Int = 60
var z: Int = 60 // Internal
```

### Casting

Casting is simple, and both strings and numeric values can be used.

- String(value)
- Double(value)
- Int(value)

When casting to an int, Swift will always round down. Therefore, if the intent is to have more control, it is recommended that you round before casting. For example:

```swift
Int(floor(value))
Int(ceil(value))
Int(round(value))
```

floor(value) will round down, ceil(value) will round up, and for normal rounding use round(value).

### Operations

Swift uses the standard set of operators:

| Operator | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| =        | Assignment          |
| ==       | Comparison          |
| +        | Addition            |
| -        | Subtraction         |
| \*       | Multiplication      |
| /        | Division            |
| %        | Modulus (remainder) |

The common increment and decrement operators, ++ and --, are deliberately not included in Swift. Instead you need to use the += and -= shortcuts, as per:

```swift
x += 1
y -= 1
```

### Properties

Properties function as per C#. They provide an easy get/set method, allowing a property to be altered like a standard variable.

The basic format is:

```swift
var name: type {
  get {
    statements
  }
  set(name) {
    statements
  }
}
```

When applied, the code becomes:

```swift
var seconds = 180

var minutes: int {
  get {
    return seconds / 60
  }
  set {
    seconds = newValue * 60
  }
}

minutes = 10
// Seconds now equals 600
```

Drop the "set", and you have a read only computed property.

```swift
var seconds = 180

var minutes: int {
  get {
    return seconds / 60
  }
}
```

## Console Output

Outputting to the console is a lot like Python - you just use a simple print() command.

```swift
print("Hello world")
```

You can concatenate within the string using "+".

```swift
var str = "Stewart"
print("Hello " + str)
```

Can include variables within the string using the format `\(<variable>)`. The variable will be replaced with its content.

```swift
var num = 2
print("Hello \(num)")
```

## Conditionals

Overall, conditionals are similar to C, C++, Java, C# and many other languages, as are the conditional operators: ==, &&, ||, !, >, >=

```swift
if (a == b && !c) {
}
else if (a == b) {
}
else {
}
```

### Ternary Conditionals

Ternary conditionals are quick conditionals in three parts:

```swift
condition ? true : false
```

For example, the following code will print "5".

```swift
var y = 2
var x = (y == 2 ? 5 : 0)
print(x)
```

Because y is equal to two, it passes the condition (y == 2), and therefore the "true" result is outputted: 5. If y was equal to 3 it would fail the condition, and therefore 0 would be the result.

### Switch

Switch/Case is similar to what we find in other languages such as Java, but it does not "fall through" by default. The format is similar to other languages:

```swift
var y = 0

switch y {
  case 0:
    print("None")
  case 1:
    print("One")
  default:
    print("Some")
}
```

In this situation, as y is equal to 0 it meets the condition of the first case statement, and therefore prints "None" to the console. However, because switch in Swift does not fall through, it ends there. Had we used similar code in Java it would have printed "None", but then gone on to print "One" and "Some" as well.

Another nice touch is that Swift supports multiple values in case conditions.

```swift
var y = 3

switch y {
  case 0:
    print("None")
  case 1,2,3:
    print("Some")
  default:
    print("Many")
}
```

As y is equal to 3, it meets the second case which covers the values 1, 2 and 3. Therefore it will output "Some" to the console.

If you do wish to fall through, you can use the "fallthrough" statement.

```swift
var y = 3

switch y {
  case 0:
    print("None")
  case 1,2,3:
    print("Some or ")
    fallthrough
  default:
    print("Many")
}
```

Because of the fallthrough, Swift will output "Some or" because it has met the condition of the second case statement, and then continue on to output "Many".

### Assertions

Assertions are used in debugging. They cause the program to terminate if the assertion fails, so they allow us to stop execution if an undesirable situation arises in the code. For example:

```swift
var y = 3

assert(y > 5)
```

Clearly, y is not greater than 5, so it will fail the assertion and the program will end. To make it a bit more useful we can output a message saying what happened:

```swift
assert(y > 5, "failed")
```

(Technically, the message "failed" isn't very useful, so a more descriptive message would be better).

A more complex formulation uses assertionFailure().

```swift
if (y <= 5) {
}
else {
  assertionFailure("failed")
}
```

Here we've already defined the condition, and thus assertionFailure simply capitalises on that.

assert and assertionFailure do not affect release builds, and only cause the program to terminate in debug builds.

## Collections

There are three main types of collections which we're looking at: arrays, sets and dictionaries.

### Arrays

Arrays in Swift are similar the List or ArrayList in C# and Java - they are not fixed size, so they do not match the arrays in those other languages.

There are a few options to declare an array.

```swift
var listOfNumbers: [Int] = []
```

Here we are declaring that we are creating an empty array "[]" to contain integers "[Int]" called "listOfNumbers".

Alternatively, if we assign values when we are declaring the array, we don't need to specify the type at all:

```swift
var listOfNumbers = [1, 5, 7, 2]
```

Arrays elements are referenced by the index number. As per normal, the index starts at 0.

```swift
var listOfNumbers = [1, 5, 7, 2]
var listValue = listOfNumbers[1]
```

The value with the index of 1 is the second value in the list, and thus listValue is equal to 5. Similarly, changing the value at the specified index is simple, too:

```swift
listOfNumbers[1] = 2
```

There is also a fairly nice trick for changing multiple values in one move:

```swift
listOfNumbers[0..3] = [2, 4, 1]
```

`<array>.count` will return the number of elements in the array.

```swift
var listOfNumbers = [1, 5, 7, 2]
var listLength = listOfNumbers.count
```

Using .count we can check to see if an array is empty:

```swift
if (listOfNumbers.count == 0) {
}
```

However, Swift also provides isEmpty as an alternative:

```swift
if (listOfNumbers.isEmpty) {
}
```

We can append a new item to the end of the array (in this case the number 6):

```swift
listOfNumbers.append(6)
```

We can also insert an item into the array at a specified position (in the example, the code will add the value 9 at index 2):

```swift
listOfNumbers.insert(9, atIndex: 2)
```

(We'll return to the "atIndex" label later). Removing an item from the array also uses a function in which you specify the index:

```swift
listOfNumbers.remove(at: 1)
```

There are two more interesting aspects of arrays in Swift worth raising. The first concerns what happens when we copy an array:

```swift
var listOfNumbers = [1, 5, 7, 2]
var otherListOfNumbers = listOfNumbers
```

Even though arrays in Swift look more like Lists, the copy by value, not by reference. Thus we now have two separate arrays. They both have the same content, but changing one will not affect the other.

The other relates to adding arrays together. Combining two arrays is easy:

```swift
var listOfNumbers = [1, 5, 7]
var otherListOfNumbers = [2, 6, 4]

var newList = listOfNumbers + otherListOfNumbers
```

The result is that newList now contains the values 1, 5, 7, 2, 6 & 4.

### Sets

Sets are similar to lists, but cannot have duplicate items. Set values must be hashable - by default, all basic data types (String, Int, etc) are hashable, but this is something to keep in mind if you end up designing your own classes for use in a set.

Declaration is similar to a standard var:

```swift
var animalSet = Set<String>()
```

But even when adding initial data at the same time, you cannot implicitly declare a set as the data appears to be the same as what you would find in an array.

```swift
var animals: Set<String> = ["Cat", "Dog", "Aye-Aye"]
```

That said, you can implicitly declare the content of the set:

```swift
var animals: Set = ["Cat", "Dog", "Aye-Aye"]
```

Inserting and removing from a set are as expected, and you can check to see if a set contains a given value.

```swift
animals.insert("Horse")
animals.remove("Dog")
if (animals.contains("Aye-Aye")) {
}
```

### Dictionaries

A dictionary typically uses a string as an index, rather than an integer. It needs a key (the index) and content (the value) for each item in the dictionary.

Declaration is similar to declaring an array, but you are stating both the type of key (in this case a String) and the type of content (an Int, but it could be anything).

```swift
var animals = [String: Int]()
```

Implicit declarations are also possible - if you provide the keys and content, Swift can work out the details.

```swift
var animals = ["Cat": 1, "Dog": 6, "Aye-Aye": 72]
```

Adding a new entry is as simple as assigning a value to the new key:

```swift
animals["Horse"] = 5
```

However, removing an entry is a bit trickier. You have two choices. The first is that you can set the content to "nil"; the second is that you can use the removeValue function.

```swift
animals["cat"] = nil
animals.removeValue(forKey: "Cat")
```

That second option has the added bonus that it returns the content that was there before you removed it. This can prove useful.

```swift
var removedCount = animals.removeValue(forKey: "Cat")
```

## Functions

Functions in Swift (the same concept as method in Java) are a bit unusual, but they offer some nice features. The basic function definition is not entirely unlike Java, although the order is a bit different.

```swift
func hello() -> String {
  return "Hello world"
}
print(hello())
```

In the above example I haven't declared it to be public or private, but if I did I would add that before "func". "func" is the keyword indicating that we are defining a function. The name of the function follows ("hello") and any parameters - in this case none, indicated by the empty brackets "()". The return type is a String, and it is indicated by the arrow symbol "->". As with other languages that use a c-type syntax, we use braces to denote the function block, and in this case we're returning a String using the "return" statement. We use the function in the print statement, and predictably the output will be "Hello world".

So far, this looking pretty ordinary, given the slightly different syntax for people using C# and/or Java. The main differences start to appear when we look at parameters.

```swift
func hello(person: String) -> String {
  return "Hello " + person
}
print(hello(person: "Stewart"))
```

The parameter in the function definition looks normal - we're simply declaring the name and the type, in the same way that we would declare these as a var. However, there are two significant differences. The first is that the resulting variable - "person" - is final and can't be changed. So you can't have in your function a line such as "person = greeting + person" - you would need to make a new local variable and assign the contents of person to it. The second, though, is that the name is both a normal variable name and a label. When you look at the function call, hello(person: "Stewart"), you see that label appear. When you call functions in Swift you need to include the labels for the parameters, not just the values to assign.

That said, the label does not have to match the parameter name. In the code that follows, the parameter is called "person" but the label is "to".

```swift
func hello(to person: String) -> String {
  return "Hello " + person
}
```

The advantage here is that we get a sort of self-documentation in the code. Now when we use the hello function we write:

```swift
hello(to: "Stewart")
```

You will see this all of the time in Swift, where labels are used to help make the code easier to follow.

The use of labels creates an interesting difference between Swift and Java/C#. In the latter two languages, you cannot have two methods with the same name and the same parameter type. Thus one class cannot have two methods called "set" with a single string as the parameter, as there is no means by which Java or C# could tell them apart. Swift, on the other hand, distinguishes between them via the labels. Thus the following approach is not just viable, but common:

```swift
func set(name title: String) -> String {
  return "The name is " + title
}

func set(city title: String) -> String {
  return "The city is " + title
}

set(name: "Stewart")
set(city: "Adelaide")
```

That said, you don't always need to include a label. If you set the label for the first parameter to an underscore, the label is no longer required.

```swift
func hello(_ person: String) -> String {
  return "Hello " + person
}
hello("Stewart")
```

This only holds for the first parameter - if you have more than one, the second and subsequent parameters must have labels:

```swift
func hello(_ person: String, alive: Bool) -> String {
  return "Hello " + person
}
hello("Stewart", alive: true)
```

Another neat trick is that we can make a parameter optional if we assign it a default value. In the above example there is a boolean. If we give it an initial value:

```swift
func hello(_ person: String, alive: Bool = true) -> String {
  return "Hello " + person
}
```

The parameter is now optional, and we can use hello("Stewart"), hello("Stewart", alive: true) and hello("Stewart", alive: false)

Finally, a couple of interesting aspects of returning values in Swift functions. The first isn't terribly useful, but is neat: the return statement can be implicit. Both of the following two functions will work:

```swift
func hello() -> String {
  return "Hello world"
}
```

```swift
func hello() -> String {
  "Hello world"
}
```

Second, unlike with many other languages, it is possible in Swift to return multiple values from a function, without using sneaky methods such as returning an array or a custom class. If, for example, you wished to return two Strings:

```swift
func hello(_ person: String) -> (name: String, welcome: String) {
  return (person, "Hello ")
}
```

The labels for the return values allow us to access the two Strings. For example:

```swift
var result = hello("Stewart")
print(result.welcome + result.name)
```

## Loops

### for â€¦ in

for ... in loops cover both for and foreach loops, and are similar to the approach in Python. In general, a for loop iterates through a set, so the most basic form is to give a range of values and ask Swift to loop through them. Thus we get:

```swift
for x in 1...3 {
  print("x = \(x)")
}
```

This is roughly the equivalent of the Java/C# code:

```java
for (int x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
}
```

The "1...3" is the range to loop through, the x is what to assign each value to. However, things get a bit more complex if we want to do something more complex, such as loop backwards or have steps greater than one. There we need a function to create the range, and "stride" provides that service.

```swift
for x in stride(from: 3, through: 1, by: -1) {
  print("x = \(x)")
}
```

In the above example, we are counting from 3, through to 1, going by -1 each time.

Along with a "for" loop, "for â€¦ in" also replaces foreach for iterating through a collection. For example:

```swift
var animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Aye-Aye"]

for animal in animals {
  print("animal = \(animal)")
}
```

Dictionaries use a very similar format:

```swift
var animals = ["Cat": 1, "Dog": 10, "Aye-Aye": 98]

for (animal, num) in animals {
  print("\(animal) = \(num)")
}
```

(It should be noted that dictionaries do not necessarily output in the insertion order).

### While loops

While loops are just like in other languages, with no surprises. They loop while the condition returns true, and if it is never met, it never loops.

```swift
var x = 0

while x < 3 {
  print("x = \(x)")
  x += 1
}
```

### repeat â€¦ while loops

repeat â€¦ while is, as with the while loop, reasonably standard. They differ from the while loop as they will loop once before it checks the condition, so even if the condition would return false, you will get one cycle of the loop.

```swift
var x = 3
repeat {
  print("x = \(x)")
  x += 1
} while x < 3
```

The above code will return "x = 3", even though there was never a situation when x was less than 3.


## Classes
Basic class definition:
```swift
class MyClass {
}
```

### Initializers
Basic initializer and using `self`:
```swift
class MyClass {
  var name: String
  
  init() {
    name = "Stewart"
  }
}

class MyClass {
  var name: String
  
  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}
```

Setting constants in initializers:
```swift
class MyClass {
  let name: String
  
  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}
```

### Convenience Initializers
Overloading initializers:
```swift
class MyClass {
  let name: String
  
  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  convenience init() {
    self.init(name: "Anonymous")
  }
}
```

### Deinitializers
Clean-up before destruction:
```swift
class MyClass {
  let name: String
  
  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }

  deinit {
    Store.saveName(name)
  }
}
```

### Structs
Value types with auto-generated initializers:
```swift
struct MyStruct {
  var name: String
}

// Usage
var myStruct = MyStruct(name: "Stewart")
```

### Inheritance
Basic inheritance and overriding:
```swift
class MySuperClass {}
class MyClass: MySuperClass {}

// Method overriding
class MySuperClass {
  func getName() -> String {
    return "Stewart"
  }  
}

class MySubClass: MySuperClass {
  override func getName() -> String {
    return "Jo"
  }  
}

// Property overriding
class MySuperClass {
  var name: String {
    get { return "Stewart" }
  }  
}

class MySubClass: MySuperClass {
  override var name: String {
    get { return "Jo" }
  }  
}
```

Preventing overriding with `final`:
```swift
class MySuperClass {
  final var name: String {
    get { return "Stewart" }
  }  
}

final class MyFinalClass {
  var name: String {
    get { return "Stewart" }
  }  
}
```

### Protocols
Protocol definition and implementation:
```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
  func method1()
  func method2()
}

class MyClass: MyProtocol {
  func method1() {}
  func method2() {}
}
```

Protocols with properties:
```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
  var name: String { get }
}

struct MyStruct: MyProtocol {
  var name: String
}

struct CustomStruct: MyProtocol {
  var fullname: String
  var name: String {
    return fullname
  }
}
```

Protocols with initializers:
```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
  init(name: String)
}

class Person: MyProtocol {
  var name: String
  required init(name: String) {
    self.name = name
  }
}
```

### Optionality
Optional properties and unwrapping:
```swift
struct Person {
  var name: String?
}

// Usage
var person1 = Person(name: "Jo")
var person2 = Person()

// Printing with unwrapping
print("\(person1.name!)")  // Force unwrap (risky)
print("\(person1.name)")   // Prints "Optional("Jo")"

// Optional chaining
var person: Person? = Person()
print("\(person?.name)")   // Safe access
```

### Delegation
Delegate pattern implementation:
```swift
protocol DelegateExample {
  func updateUser(user: User)
}

class UserView: DelegateExample {
  var model = Model()
  
  init() {
    model.delegate = self
  }

  func updateUser(user: User) {
    // Handle update
  }
}

class Model {
  var delegate: DelegateExample?
  
  func saveData(newUser: User) {
    // Processing...
    delegate?.updateUser(newUser)  // Optional chaining
  }
}
```

Key concepts:
1. Classes use reference semantics, structs use value semantics
2. `convenience init` must call designated initializers
3. `deinit` can't take parameters
4. Protocol requirements use `required` for initializers
5. Optionals (`?`) allow nil values, while force-unwrapping (`!`) risks crashes
6. Delegates combine protocols and optional properties for flexible architecture
