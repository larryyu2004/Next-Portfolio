# Unity LAN Discovery and Hotsport Support

## NetworkDiscovery.cs

This file handles broadcasting (host) and listening (client) using raw UDP sockets.

### Core responsibilities
- Host repeatedly broadcasts its IP address on the LAN (UDP broadcast)
- Client listens for these broadcasts and extracts the host’s IP
- Supports common iOS/Android hotspot subnets
- Runs safely on background threads
- Returns results to Unity’s main thread
