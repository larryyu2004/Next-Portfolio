# Singleton-Mode

## Introduction
- **Intro:** You only want one object of a certain class to ever exist in your app.

For example, you might want only one database connection, only one configuration manager, or only one logger to be created.

```Csharp
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }

    void Awake()
    {
        Instance = this;
        TurnToWaitingToStart();

    }
}
```
