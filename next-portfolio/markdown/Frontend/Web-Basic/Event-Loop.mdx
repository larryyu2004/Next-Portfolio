# Event Loop
- Single thread is the reason for the async.
- Event loop is the way to implement the async.

## Process Model in Browser
### What is the process?
- It must have its own memory space when the program is running; we can easily treat the memory space as a process.
- Each application has 1 process at least, and each process must be independent. Even if they want to communicate, they need agreement from each other.
```Example
YouTube -> takes up 500MB in Memory
VSCode -> takes up 1GB in Memory
Google -> takes up 750MB in Memory

If VSCode breaks, it will not influence YouTube and Google.
```
### What is the thread?
- A process needs at least 1 thread.
- When the process starts, it will automatically create a thread to run the code -> called the main thread.
- Some application needs to execute multiple codes at the same time, so they can have multiple threads.
```Example
GTA5 has a main thread -> task 1, task 2, task 3...
GTA5 has a gaming thread -> task 1, task 2, task 3...
GTA5 has a network thread -> task 1, task 2, task 3...
```

### What kinds of processes and threads does a browser have?
#### Browser is a multi-process and multi-threaded application.
- When a browser boots, it will start several processes.
1. Google Chrome has some processes:
- **Browser process** -> tab, nav, user interaction, sub-processes management... rendering, and it will have a lot of threads.
- **Network process** -> load network resource.
- **Rendering process** -> When the rendering process boots, it will start the main render process. The main render process will execute HTML, CSS, and JS. Each tab will start a new rendering process by default to prevent the influence between different tabs.

---

## How does the main rendering process work?
1. The main rendering process is the busiest thread:
- Resolve HTML
- Resolve CSS
- Calculate (rem to px, z-index, ...)
- Layout
- ...


2. How to prioritise these tasks?
- Example 1: When the process is executing a JS function, what if a user clicks a button?
- Example 2: When the process is executing a JS function, what if a timer finishes? 
- Example 3: When a user clicks a button, and there is a timer that finishes as well, which one should execute first?

```Queue
                        +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
Main Rendering Process  |   Task1   |                                   |
(Is executing)          +-----+-----+-----------+-----------+-----------+
                              |
                              +-----------+ (Task 1 may generate more tasks)
                                          |
                                          |
                        +-----------+-----v-----+-----------+-----------+
Message Queue           |   Task1   |   Task2   |   Task3   |   Task4   |
                        +-----------+-----------+-----^-----+-----^-----+
                                                      |           |
                                                      |           |
                                                   thread1     thread2
```

- At the very beginning, the main rendering process will enter an infinite loop.
```CPP
// Chrome source code
// message_pump_default.cpp
void MessagePumpDefault::Run(Delegate* delegate) {
  AutoReset<bool> auto_reset_keep_running(&keep_running_, true);

  for (;;) {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
- In each loop, it will check if there is any task in the message queue. If so, it will execute the first task. After finishing executing that, it will enter the next loop. If not, it will enter sleep mode.
- Other threads can push tasks to message to the back of the message queue. When pushing new tasks, if the main process is in sleep mode, it will wake up the main process so that the process can fetch the new tasks.


### What is async?
1. When executing code, there will be some tasks that cannot be executed immediately:
- Timer: `setTimeout()`, `setInterval`;
- Network Communication: `Fetch`;
- After operation from user: `addEventListener()`;

2. If the main rendering process needs to wait for these tasks, it will be on block states -> making the browser laggy.
```Queue
                                           (On block state, waiting...) (Execute the timer callback)
                        +-----------------+---------------------------+----------------+
Main Rendering Process  |   time starts   |           Block           |  Execute task  |
(Is executing)          +--------+--------+---------------------------^----------------+
                                 |                                    |
        +------------------------+ (inform timing thread)             +--------------------+
        |                                                                                  | 
        v               +----------------+------------------------+-----------------+      |

                        +----------------+------------------------+-----------------+

```
- That's why the main rendering thread must not be blocked.
- That's why the browser chooses async.

```Queue
                        +-----------------+--------------------------------------------+
Main Rendering Process  |   time starts   |  Task0           ...                       |

                |                                                 |
                |                                                 +---------+
                |                                                           |

                        +----------------+------------------------+-----------------+
```
- The timer callback function will be added to the Message Queue

#### How to understand the async in JS?**

JS is a single-threaded language, it is because it runs in the main rendering thread, and there is only one main rendering thread. The main rendering thread will do a lot of jobs, such as rendering pages, executing JS code.
If we use sync, it will block the main rendering thread, so that the following tasks in the message queue cannot be executed. It will waste the time of the main rendering thread and also cannot update the page on time, leading to lag.

So the browser chooses async to avoid it. When a timer, network or event listener happens, the main rendering thread will pass these to other threads, finish these tasks immediately and pick up the following tasks. When other threads finish their task, they will pack these callback functions as some tasks and push them to the back of the message queue, waiting for dispatch and executing from the main rendering thread.
With the async, the browser will never block and make sure the single thread can run smoothly.

### Why JS will block rendering.
```HTML
<h1>Mr.Yu is awesome!</h1> 
<button>change</button> 
<script>
    var h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
    var btn = document.querySelector('button');

    // Endless loop
    function delay(duration) {
        var start = Date.now():
        while (Date.now() - start ‹ duration) {}
    }
    btn.onclick = function () {
        h1.textContent ='Mr. Yu is handsome!'；
        delay(3000);
    };
</script>
```
1. Why does the user click the button, and it waits for 3 seconds instead of changing the h1 immediately?
```Queue
                        +---------------------+--------+------------------------------------+
Main Rendering Process  |   execute JS code   |   Fn  -> Delay 3000ms       ...             |
                        +--------+------------+----^---+------------------------------------+
                                 |                 |
(Inform Event Listener Thread)   |                 |
                        +--------+                 |
                        |             +------------+
                        |       +-----v-----+-----------+-----------+-----------+
Message Queue           |       |    Fn     |                ...                |
                        |       +-----^-----+-----------+-----------+-----------+
                        |             |
                        |             |
                        |             |
                        |       +-----^------------------------+
Event Listener Thread<--+       |     if click, execute fn     |
(If the user clicks the button) +------------------------------+
```
- Fn in the main rendering thread will set the DOM text to 'Mr. Yu is handsome!' and add a rendering task in the message queue.
- Fn will call `delay(3000)` as well. So, in the main rendering thread, it will stop after 3000ms.
- Then it will fetch the tasks in the message queue to render the new h1 text.
- So, when the main rendering process is stopping, if you scroll the page, click other buttons, or change the window size, they all need to wait in the message queue (nothing will happen when stopping -> laggy).
- JS and rendering tasks are both in the main rendering thread, so that's why JS will block rendering.

### Does the task have priority?
1. Tasks have no priority.
2. Message queues have priority.

#### The explanation from W3C:
- Each task has its task type. The same type of task must be in the same queue.
- Different types of tasks can be allocated to different message queues, or they can be allocated in the same message queue.
- In each event loop, the browser can fetch the tasks from different message queues.
- The browser must have a micro-task queue; tasks in it must be executed before any other tasks.

#### Message queues in Chrome
1. Delay queue: store the callback functions after the timer over (Priority: median);
2. Interaction queue: store the tasks after the interaction of the user (Priority: high);
3. Micro-task queue: store some tasks that need to be executed first (Priority: highest)

#### How to add tasks to the micro-task queue:
```JS
// Add the function to the micro-task queue.
Promise.resolve().then(function())
```
#### Question1
```JS
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(1)
}, 0);

console.log(2)
```
It will print 2, then 1. Why?
1. The main rendering thread will execute JS code at first (`setTimeout` then `console.log(2)`).
2. Main rendering thread calls timing thread to set timer (0s).
3. Timing thread finish and push the `console.log(1)` to the delay queue.
4. Main rendering thread finishes executing `console.log(2)`.
5. The main rendering thread is now idle.
6. The main rendering thread finds that the delay queue has a task.
7. The main rendering thread fetches the task from the delay queue and executes it.
8. Print 2 and then 1.

#### Question2
```JS
function delay(duration) {
    var start = Date.now():
    while (Date.now() - start < duration) {};
}

setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(1)
}, 0);

delay(1000);

console.log(2);
```
It will wait for 1000ms, print 2, then 1.
1. The main rendering thread will execute JS code at first (`setTimeout`, `delay(1000)`, `console.log(2)`).
2. Main rendering thread calls timing thread to set timer (0s).
3. Timing thread finish and push the `console.log(1)` to the delay queue.
4. The main rendering thread will execute `delay(1000)`.
5. Main rendering thread finishes executing `console.log(2)`.
6. The main rendering thread is idle.
7. The main rendering thread finds a delay queue and has a task.
8. The main rendering thread fetches the task from the delay queue and executes it.
9. Print 2 and then 1.

#### Question3
```JS
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(1);
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(function () {
    console.log(2);
});

console.log(3);
```
It will print 3, 2, then 1.
1. The main rendering thread will execute JS code at first.
2. Main rendering thread calls timing thread to set timer (0s).
3. Timing thread finish and push the `console.log(1)` to the delay queue.
4. (Main rendering thread will finish all the tasks itself, then go to message queues), push `console.log(2)` to micro-task queue.
5. Print 3.
6. Check micro-task queue, print 2.
7. Print 1.

#### Question4
```JS
function a () {
    console.log(1);
    Promise.resolve().then(function () {
        console.log(2);
    });
};

setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(3);
    Promise.resolve().then(a);
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(function () {
    console.log(4);
});

console.log(5);
```
1. The main rendering thread will execute JS code at first.
2. Main rendering thread calls timing thread to set timer (0s).
3. Timing thread finish and push the `console.log(3)` and `Promise.resolve().then(a);` to the delay queue.
4. Push `console.log(4)` to micro-task queue.
5. Print 5.
6. Check micro-task queue, print 4.
7. Check the delay queue, print 3 and push `function a` to the micro-task queue.
8. Print 1 and push `console.log(2)` to micro-task queue.
9. Check micro-task queue, print 2.

#### Can you explain the event loop in JavaScript?**
The event loop is a message loop, it is how the browser works.

In the source code of Chrome, it will start an infinite loop, and each time the main rendering thread will fetch the first task from the message queue. The other thread will push some tasks to the back of the message queue.

Before we had micro message queue and macro message queue, but now we make it more flexible.

Based on the W3C, each task has its own type; tasks of the same type will be allocated to the same queue, and different types of tasks can be allocated to different message queues. Different message queues have different priorities. In each message queue, the browser will determine which message queue it will fetch tasks from. But the browser must have a micro-task queue, the micro-task queue has the highest priority, and it must be dispatched and executed first.

<Key>
#### **Can the timer in JS achieve precise timing?**

No, Computer hardware does not have an atomic clock and thus cannot achieve precise timekeeping.

The timer function from the OS itself has a small amount of deviation. Because the timer in the JS will call the timer from the OS, it will carry these deviations.

Based on the W3C standard, when a browser implements the timer, if the nesting level exceeds 5 levels, it will have a minimum time of 4 milliseconds. This brings a deviation when the timing is less than 4 milliseconds.

Affected by the event loop, the callback function of the timer can only run when the main thread is idle, thus bringing about another deviation.
