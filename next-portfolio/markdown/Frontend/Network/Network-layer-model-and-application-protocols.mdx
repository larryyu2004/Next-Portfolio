# Network layer model and application protocols

## Hierarchical Model

### Five-Layer Hierarchical Model

- What message formats are relevant to specific applications? -> Application Layer (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3)
- How to ensure reliable delivery of messages? -> Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
- How to find each other on the Internet? -> Network Layer (IP, Router)
- How to find each other in a subnet? -> Data Link Layer (MAC, Switch)
- How can I signal what I have given above? -> Physical Layer (Fiber optic, twisted pair, coaxial cable, hub)

### Data Transmission

```Text
Send text:

1. Application Layer:
+-----------+
|   Text    |
+-----------+

2. Transport Layer:
+---+-----------+
| T |   Text    |
+---+-----------+

3. Network Layer:
+---+---+-----------+
| N | T |   Text    |
+---+---+-----------+

4. Data Link Layer:
+---+---+---+-----------+---+
| D | N | T |   Text    | D |
+---+---+---+-----------+---+

5. Physical Layer
01010010110100101...

Receive test:

1. Physical Layer
01010010110100101...

2. Data Link Layer:
+---+---+---+-----------+---+
| D | N | T |   Text    | D |
+---+---+---+-----------+---+

3. Network Layer:
+---+---+-----------+
| N | T |   Text    |
+---+---+-----------+

4. Transport Layer:
+---+-----------+
| T |   Text    |
+---+-----------+

5. Application Layer:
+-----------+
|   Text    |
+-----------+
```

## Application Layer Protocol

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
#### Used to locate the service of the network
- http://a.com:80/news/detail?id=1#t1
1. schema -> http
2. domain -> a.com
3. port -> 80
4. path -> /news/detail
5. query -> ?id=1
6. hash -> #t1
- From which service **(path)** from which program **(port)** in which computer **(domain)** in the network, and indicate the specific details **(path)** of obtaining the service and what kind of protocol communication **(schema)** should be used.

## Note
- When it is **HTTP** Protocol and the post is **80**, we can dismiss the port.
- When it is **HTTPS** Protocol and the post is **443**, we can dismiss the port.
- **schema, domain, path**

<Tip>
#### `<a herf="https://www.google.com/">` and `<a herf="https://www.google.com">` which one is better?
#### Answer: `<a herf="https://www.google.com/">` is better
- `<a herf="https://www.google.com/">` will go to the source root of the google.
- If we use `<a herf="https://www.google.com">`, browser will find the URL is imcompleted (lack path), browser will help you complete.
</Tip>

<Key>
#### Why we can use **Live Server** to access files?
#### Because it is a **Static Resource Server**
- Boost Live Server program.
- Open the browser, access the http://localhost:5500/index.html automatically.

### HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
#### The mode of transmitting messages
```Text
                    1. Request
        --------------------------------------> 
Client                                          Server
        <--------------------------------------
                    2. Response
```
