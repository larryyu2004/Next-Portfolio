## **Conducting Interviews & Collating Results**

### **Key Findings (Roleplay Summary):**
- **Gamers:** Urged for anti-bot measures and quicker checkout processes.
- **Parents:** Emphasized a need for clearer product differentiation (e.g., visuals, naming).
- **Retailers:** Requested real-time stock updates and standardized pre-order code systems.

### **Primary Stakeholder Insight:**
**Retailers** offered the most actionable insights, particularly regarding logistics and system reliability. This led to the proposed implementation of **automated pre-order code distribution** integrated with real-time inventory tracking.

### **Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Anti-Scalping Measures:** Enforce mandatory two-factor authentication for all Xbox membership accounts.
2. **Product Clarity:** Introduce distinctive colors and icons for console variants (e.g., *Xbox Nova* vs. *Xbox Pulse*).
3. **Retailer Portal:** Develop a dedicated dashboard for real-time stock monitoring and automated code generation.
